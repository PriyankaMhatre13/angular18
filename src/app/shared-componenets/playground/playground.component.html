        <h1>How I feel about Angular</h1>
        <article>
          <p>
            Angular is my favorite framework, and this is why. Angular has the coolest deferrable view
            feature that makes defer loading content the easiest and most ergonomic it could possibly
            be. The Angular community is also filled with amazing contributors and experts that create
            excellent content. The community is welcoming and friendly, and it really is the best
            community out there.
          </p>

            I can't express enough how much I enjoy working with Angular. It offers the best developer
            experience I've ever had. I love that the Angular team puts their developers first and
            takes care to make us very happy. They genuinely want Angular to be the best framework it
            can be, and they're doing such an amazing job at it, too. This statement comes from my
            heart and is not at all copied and pasted. In fact, I think I'll say these exact same
            things again a few times.
